# Citizen Browser - Political Group Recommendations
This repository contains code to reproduce the findings featured in our story, "[Facebook Said It Would Stop Pushing Users to Join Partisan Political Groups. It Didnâ€™t.](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt)" from our series, [Citizen Browser](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/).

Our methodology is described in "[How We Built a Facebook Inspector](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/how-we-built-a-facebook-inspector)".

## data/
The `data/` directory contains several spreadsheets.

`top_100_groups.csv` contains the top 100 groups recommended to our 1,917 panelists in December 2020.<br>
`top_groups_political.csv` contains the subset of 11 political groups from the top 100 recommended groups.

We also have the same spreadsheets for Biden (N=1,214), Trump (N=508) and non-voters (N=155).<br>
`top_100_groups_{X}_voters.csv` contains the top 100 groups recommended to X-voters in December 2020.<br>
`top_groups_political_{X}_voters.csv` contains the subset of political groups from the top 100 recommended groups for X-voters.

Each of these spreadsheets in formatted similarly, containing some subset of the following columns.
